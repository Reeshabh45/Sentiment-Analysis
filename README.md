# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to analyze the sentiment expressed in textual data and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset

The sentiment analysis model was trained on a dataset comprising 1.6 million rows of text data. The dataset covers a diverse range of sources, including social media, customer reviews, and news articles. Please note that due to the size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. You can obtain the dataset from [insert link to dataset source].

## Model Architecture

The core of the sentiment analysis is the LSTM neural network. LSTM networks are chosen for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for natural language processing tasks.

The model architecture includes the following components:
-  Embedding Layer: Converts input text into dense vectors.
- LSTM Layer: A Long Short-Term Memory layer with 100 units, dropout of 0.2, and recurrent dropout of 0.2 to capture sequential dependencies in the data.
- Dense Layer 1: A dense layer with 50 units and ReLU activation function.
- Dense Layer 2: The output layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation for sentiment classification.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
- Python 3.10.12
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Keras
- Word2Vec
- [Other dependencies, if any]
